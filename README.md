# Business Landing Page Website

This landing page represents a significant milestone in my learning journey with React. Along the way, I also explored Vite, TypeScript, and other related tools. I thoroughly enjoyed experimenting with React's capabilities in building dynamic and efficient websites. One of the aspects I find most impressive about React is its reusable components, which streamline development compared to traditional methods that require creating multiple individual pages for larger websites.

To test my skills further, I challenged myself to build a simple landing page using React.
